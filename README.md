This repo contains code to enable stochastic (i.e. monte carlo based) simulations of the basin-scale aggregate impacts of agricultural conservation practices (ACPs) on nutrient (i.e., total nitrogen and phosphorus) loads. Please contact Grey Evenson (evenson.grey@epa.gov) with questions.

./src directory contains module code while ./examples contains example applications of the module code, specifically for the East Fork (OH) watershed
